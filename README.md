# Rock Paper Scisscors

The objective of this code is to work with flow control, boolean statements, and practice with importing Python features. We call random so the computer can make a 'choice'. Sys so that we can use q call sys.exit which closes the program and prevents infinite loops.

# main loop

The main loop checks for correct input.
If q then runs sys.exit() which quits.
If r, p, s then prints choice and breaks the loop.
If any other character prints error and returns to beginning of loop.

# How the computer decides

We relate a number to a selection
1 for Rock
2 for Paper
3 for Scisscors

# Results

Finally at the end of the code we list out each possible move match, print if the player wins, loses, or ties with the computer's choice. Then it adds to the score.
